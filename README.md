# Sentiment Analyzer using DistilBERT

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analyzer** — a simple and intuitive web app that helps you understand the sentiment behind your text. Whether you're writing a product review, analyzing feedback, or just curious about how a sentence might "feel" to a machine, this app has got you covered.

Built using **Streamlit** and powered by a fine-tuned **DistilBERT** model, it classifies text as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** in real time.

## 🧐 What This App Does

Just paste or type in any sentence(s), and it’ll instantly tell you what sentiment it detects:
- **Positive** → Great vibes, compliments, happy tones.
- **Neutral** → Objective or emotionless statements.
- **Negative** → Complaints, frustrations, or critical tones.

It supports **multiple lines at once**, so you can check a whole batch of feedback in one go!
